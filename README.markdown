# Work in progress

I am currently porting the MySQL parts to PostgreSQL, hoping to
maintain the rest of the API verbatim.

# pgsql-simple: mid-level bindings to PostgreSQL servers

This library is a mid-level Haskell binding to PostgreSQL servers. It
is aimed at speed and ease of use.

# Licensing

This library is BSD-licensed.

# Authors

This library is written and maintained by Chris Done,
<chrisdone@gmail.com>.

This library is also directly forked from mysql-simple, written and
maintained by Bryan O'Sullivan, <bos@mailrank.com>, with the MySQL
parts changed to PostgreSQL, in order to have a consistent API.
